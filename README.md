Farse: F# Parsing &amp; Formatting
==================================

The F# libraries (`Farse.Markdown`) includes an F# parser that can be used to parse the [MarkDown][1] language into an [AST][2] which can then be used to output or examine the Markdown structure.

Also included are some formatters (`Farse.Markdown.Html` &amp; `Farse.Markdown.Xaml`) that output their respective declarative implementations, and can serve as examples of how to implement your own formatters.

### Documentation

You're on your own for now.  Take a look at the source!  

When I have time I'll write up some better documentation.

### License

The libraries are available under Apache 2.0.  For more information see the [License file][3] in the GitHub repository.
